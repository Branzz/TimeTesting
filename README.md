# TimeTesting
for Collection methods or your own

When worked on: Jan 2021

Saw online that ArrayDeque might be faster than ArrayList, so I had to investigate.

Type in the name or names of a method and it'll find it in all the Collections and Maps and test the average time with predictive arguments at a given size range and trial amount, then graph it. Useful moreso for seeing the asymptotic nature.
